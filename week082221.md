1. Pray for discernment
1. Does the message come directly from the person or organization, and not a second-hand source or forwarded source 
	1. … “I heard from…”    “I’ve been asked by…”   “I’m forwarding a post from…”   “I heard that [X] said …”
1. Reach out to the party or organization First Hand
1. Does it fit with the individual’s or organization’s prior messages
1. Facebook, Instagram & Twitter ‘Blue Checkmark’
1. Check with on-line sources … getting harder to do

1. With some additional commentary from Randy…
	1. What is Eschatology?
	1. Eschatology is derived from the Greek word eschatos, which means “last in time or in place” (Thayer’s Greek Lexicon).
	1. How we view Eschatology has a direct impact on how we look at current world events, how we live our lives, & what we invest our time in (God’s plan for us & mankind) 
	1. Controversial: Some churches avoid Eschatology as an area of study
		1. (Calvary Chapel’s position on eschatology: https://bit.ly/3mm4Edv)
	1. Proper Hermeneutics (understanding/ interpretation) is a must – literal, historical, grammatical, & contextual
		1. Context, Context, Context (“Text without context is pretext”)
	1. Why study eschatology if it’s so controversial?
		1. We receive a blessing according to Rev 1:3
		1. The Bible is over 25% prophecy
			1. 1,845 OT references to Christ’s RETURN (17 OT Books)
			1. 318 NT references to Christ’s RETURN (216 chapters in 23 books)
		1. Prophecy is meant to PREPARE us, not SCARE us the world isn’t falling apart, the pieces are falling together
