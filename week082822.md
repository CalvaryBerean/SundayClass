1. If you have an emergency food supply, consider adding some Bibles with this note tucked in:

	“If you are taking these supplies, you may be wondering where my wife and I are.  As fantastic as it may sound, we’re home with Jesus.  As you take these supplies and food, please be sure to take this and the other Bibles as well.  They are the most important supplies in this closet!  Please pay attention to the last book in the Bible as it lays out what is coming… it’s NOT science fiction.  Pay particular attention to Revelation 13:16-17 and Revelation 14:9-13.
	
	We pray you too accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.  The instruction book is in your hand.  This isn’t a joke, and will be the most important decision you can ever make.  The next few years won’t be easy, but remember, fear God, not man; accept Jesus, not the world’s solution.”
