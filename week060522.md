## Some commentary on Revelation 13:16-18
1. Remember, the ‘mark’ is tied to the forehead or right hand 
1. “**Mark**” … **Charagma** (khar'-ag-mah): **a stamp, impress** (sculpture; engraving, a sign)
1. “**Hand**” … **Cheir** (khire):  **the hand**
1. “**Forehead**” … **metópon** (met'-o-pon): **the forehead** – properly, "after the eye"
1. **Note that the parts of the body listed are the primary biometric identifiers that are unique to you;** 
	1. **hand** = palm & fingerprints
	1. **forehead** = BCP, 
	1. **‘after the eye’** = retinal scan  
1. **The mark is received on the heart and soul of a person YEARS before they take the mark on their hand or forehead.**
1. The mark of the beast may grant temporary mortal survival during the tribulation, but in taking it, the results are eternal damnation
	1. Read Revelation 14:9-11
