## Revelation, Chapter 11
[New American Standard Bible](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/11.htm)


**The Two Witnesses**

[**1**] Then there was given to me a [**(a)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/11.htm#fn)measuring rod like a staff; [**(b)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/11.htm#fn)and someone said, “Get up and measure the [**(c)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/11.htm#fn)temple of God and the altar, and those who worship in it. 

[**2**] [**(d)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/11.htm#fn)Leave out the courtyard which is outside the [**(e)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/11.htm#fn)temple and do not measure it, because it has been given to the nations; and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months. 

[**3**] And I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.” 

[**4**] These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. 

[**5**] And if anyone wants to harm them, fire flows out of their mouth and devours their enemies; and so if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way. 

[**6**] These have the power to shut up the sky, so that rain will not fall during the days of their prophesying; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.

[**7**] When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them and kill them. 

[**8**] And their dead bodies will lie on the street of the great city which [**(f)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/11.htm#fn)spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. 

[**9**] Those from the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations will look at their dead [**(g)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/11.htm#fn)bodies for three and a half days, and [**(h)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/11.htm#fn)will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb. 

[**10**] And those who live on the earth will rejoice over them and celebrate; and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who live on the earth.

[**11**] And after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God came into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those who were watching them. 

[**12**] And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” And they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies watched them. 

[**13**] And [**(i)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/11.htm#fn)at that time there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; [**(j)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/11.htm#fn)seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.

[**14**] The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is coming quickly.

**The Seventh Trumpet: Christ’s Reign Foreseen**

[**15**] Then the seventh angel sounded; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying,

“The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His [**(k)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/11.htm#fn)Christ; and He will reign forever and ever.” 

[**16**] And the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God, 

[**17**] saying,

“We give You thanks, Lord God, the Almighty, the One who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and have begun to reign. 

[**18**] And the nations were enraged, and Your wrath came, and the time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to [**(l)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/11.htm#fn)reward Your bond-servants the prophets and the [**(m)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/11.htm#fn)saints and those who fear Your name, the small and the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth.”

[**19**] And the [**(n)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/11.htm#fn)temple of God which is in heaven was opened; and the ark of His covenant appeared in His [**(o)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/11.htm#fn)temple, and there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder, and an earthquake, and a great [**(p)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/11.htm#fn)hailstorm.
