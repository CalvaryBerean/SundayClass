1. Correction/Clarification on last week’s question of why Dan is not listed in Revelation 7:4-8:  
	1. Truth is, the Bible doesn’t say why Dan is not listed.  Commentators have proposed the following reasons for the exclusion of the tribe of Dan:
		1. Dan’s embrace of idolatry and immorality leads to its disqualification
		1. The Antichrist will come from the tribe of Dan (based on certain readings & interpretations of Genesis 49:17; Deuteronomy 33:22; and Jeremiah 8:16).
		1. By the time of Solomon, the tribe of Dan had assimilated with the neighboring Phoenicians (as hinted at in 2 Chron 2:14) and so lost their national identity.
		1. The tribe of Dan, once the 2nd most populous tribe, declined in number & stature until, by Ezra’s time (400-300 BC), it had been totally wiped out. This would explain why Dan is not listed in 1 Chron 4:1-7 or Rev 7:4-8. 
1. Is God’s hand of protection on the Ukraine?

1. Talk by Joel Rosenberg (author of 24 books including Epicenter  and he last Jihad) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvo2IQGPdOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvo2IQGPdOs) 
1. Some key takeaways:
	1. Two SEPARATE wars are titled the “Gog Magog War” … one against Israel, one against Christ
	1. The duplicated use of the names Gog and Magog in Revelation 20:8-9 is to show that these people demonstrate the same rebellion against God and antagonism toward God as those in Ezekiel 38-39
	1. “Gog” is a Title given to a person; “Magog” refers to a people/nation(s)
