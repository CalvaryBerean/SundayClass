1. News of the Week:  Is this the reason behind Ezekiel 39:14-16?
	1. [https://bit.ly/3ArSF2f](https://bit.ly/3ArSF2f) 
	1, “They will also select men who will constantly pass through the land, burying those who were passing through, those left on the surface of the ground, in order to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they will conduct a search. 15 As those who pass through the land pass through and anyone sees a human bone, then he will [a]set up a marker by it until the burial detail has buried it in the Valley of [b]Hamon-gog. 16 And even the name of the city will be Hamonah. So they will cleanse the land.” – Ezekiel 39:14-16
	1. Commentary on Ezekiel 39:14-16  -  According to verse 14, the Israeli government will hire full-time professionals (men of continual employment) to oversee the burial and decontamination work. This sounds like the type of work needed after nuclear war -- or biological or chemical warfare. If it was a supernatural meteorite shower, the rocks would fall and the corpses would be buried in rubble. Then it would just take a few weeks of work with bulldozers (and vultures) to deal with the mess. Instead, this cleanup is very odd. Passersby don't just bury what they find; they erect markers and let the professionals carry the stuff away to a designated waste area. Sounds like the remains will be radioactive. Or toxic.

### Misconceptions on The Book Of Revelation
1. It is NOT the Book f Revelations  (no “s” on the end of Revelation)
1. It is NOT the Revelation OF John, it is the Revelation TO John of the Revelation OF Jesus
1. The Book of Revelation is NOT too difficult or impossible to understand.  Understanding is ‘spiritually discerned’ (“But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned”. – 1 Corinthians 2:14) … and Revelation is the only Book in the Bible that promises to bless us if we read & keep the things written in it! (that last sentence is definitely not a misconception!)
1. Who was the revelation given to?
1. The word "revelation" in Greek is apokalupsis (ap-ok-al'-oop-sis) and means "_________________” 
1. What is “unveiled”?  
1. Four times the author identifies himself as “John” (1:1,4,9; 22:8)
1. Most Secular & Religious Scholars agree it was written in 95 AD
