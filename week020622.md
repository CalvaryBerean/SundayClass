			1. I believe the mask is/was meant to be a ‘conditioning’ of us … how often have you been asked “WHERE’S YOUR MASK?”
			1. However “the mark” is administered, remember Revelation 14:9-11
				1. Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, “ If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed in full strength in the cup of His anger; and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.” Here is the perseverance of the saints who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.


## Revelation, Chapter 4
New American Standard Bible

**Scene in Heaven** 

**1** After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven, and the first voice which I had heard, like the sound of a trumpet speaking with me, said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things.” **2** Immediately I was in the **[a]** Spirit; and behold, a throne was standing in heaven, and someone was sitting on the throne. **3** And He who was sitting was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance; and there was a **[b]** rainbow around the throne, like an emerald in appearance. **4** Around the throne were twenty-four thrones; and upon the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and golden crowns on their heads.

**The Throne and Worship of the Creator** 

**5** Out from the throne *came flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are **[c]** the seven spirits of God; **6** and before the throne there was something like a sea of glass, like crystal; and in the **[d]** center and around the throne, four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind. **7** The first living creature was like a lion, the second creature like a calf, the third creature had a face like that of a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle. **8** And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within; and day and night **[e]** they do not cease to say,

“HOLY, HOLY, HOLY IS THE LORD GOD, THE ALMIGHTY, who was and who is and who **[f]** is to come.” **9** And when the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever, **10** the twenty-four elders will fall down before Him who sits on the throne, and they will worship Him who lives forever and ever, and will cast their crowns before the throne, saying, **11** “Worthy are You, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and because of Your will they **[g]** existed, and were created.”
