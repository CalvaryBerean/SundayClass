1. So which solar company is best?  YOU HAVE TO DECIDE FOR YOURSELF!!!
	1. [https://www.marketwatch.com/picks/guides/home-improvement/best-solar-companies-california/](https://www.marketwatch.com/picks/guides/home-improvement/best-solar-companies-california/)
1. Why did I choose Sunrun?
	1. 3 Primary “Financial Models” for solar companies:
		1. Purchase via loan, mechanics lien or payment 
(for my system with 11 panels & Battery back-up, I would have to pay $53,000)
		2.  Lease / Power Purchase Agreement - Sunrun replaces the electric portion of PG&E.  For the same system as above, I pay $164/month including my electric power (GAS IS EXTRA!)
		3. Outright purchase, Pre-Pay for system (for me, that would be $42,250) 
1. Other reasons I opted for Sunrun:
	1. 25 Year material Warranty (all maintained by Sunrun)
		1. 25 years for panels (typical life 30 yrs)
		2. inverter (typical life 10 yrs @ $1.5K current replacement cost)
		3. battery (typical life 10 yrs @ $12K-$15K current replacement cost)
	2. Sunrun Energy Cost: $0.19/KWh vs. PG&E Energy: $0.32-$0.49/KWh … CURRENTLY
	3. No new loan for equipment & no lien on property
	4. No incumbrances if we sell or move… benefit to new owner
	5. Must have good credit (750 or higher) to qualify for program
2. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH, but if you do go with Sunrun…
	1. Sunrun rep (Brandon Sliman) said he will grant everyone the lowest possible ‘per Kilowatt Hour” power price (they have 4 rates), but you need to mention the Berean class
	2. IF the class is interested, I can arrange a 10-15 minute Q&A video chat with Brandon, but this is a SUNDAY SCHOOL CLASS and our focus needs to be on the SON, not the sun
	3. Brandon’s direct email is brandon.sliman@ sunrun.com and his cell # (916) 532-9982

## Chuck Missler expands on Revelation 15   
1. Chuck Missler discusses:
	1. the ‘sea of glass mingled with fire’
	2. the decline of the fear of God within our culture … even among believers
	3. the fact that “the temple” is mentioned 15 times in Revelation, but never until Chapter 4, after the Church is in heaven
