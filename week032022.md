## Questions on Revelation 8
1. “Why was there silence in heaven for half of hour when the 7th seal was broken?”
	1. Scripture doesn’t give a specific reason for the silence in heaven.  Some possibilities include:
		1. The ½ hour silence is a sign of deep respect & awe in the presence of the Judge of all the earth. 
			1. “Be silent before the Sovereign LORD, for the day of the LORD is near”	  [Zeph 1:7](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Zeph%201.7)
			1. “The LORD is in his holy temple; let all the earth be silent before him” 	  [Hab 2:20](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Hab%202.20).
		1. The ½ hour silence is due to reflection on what has just been revealed. Now all heaven can see God’s plan to judge the wickedness of the earth, destroy the kingdom of the beast, & set things right. 
			1. “I am unworthy - how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth”     [Job 40:4](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Job%2040.4).
		1.  The ½ hour silence is due to the severity of the actions God is about to occur. With the scroll fully opened, heaven can see the trumpet judgments. These judgments are worse than anything the world’s ever seen [Mk 13:19–20](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Mark%2013.19–20).
			1. “Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD, for he has roused himself from his holy dwelling” [Zechariah 2:13](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Mark%2013.19–20).

## Revelation, Chapter 9
[New American Standard Bible](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/9.htm)

The Fifth Trumpet: Shaft of the Abyss

[**1**] Then the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven which had fallen to the earth; and the key to the shaft of the abyss was given to him. 

[**2**] He opened the shaft of the abyss, and smoke ascended out of the shaft like the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened from the smoke of the shaft. 

[**3**] Then out of the smoke came locusts [**(a)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/9.htm#fn)upon the earth, and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power. 

[**4**] They were told not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only the people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads. 

[**5**] And [**(b)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/9.htm#fn)they were not permitted to kill [**(c)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/9.htm#fn)anyone, but to torment for five months; and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it [**(d)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/9.htm#fn)stings a person. 

[**6**] And in those days people will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, and death [**(e)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/9.htm#fn)will flee from them!

[**7**] The [**(f)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/9.htm#fn)appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle; and on their heads appeared to be crowns like gold, and their faces were like human faces. 

[**8**] They had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions. 

[**9**] They had breastplates like breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to battle. 

[**10**] They have tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt people for five months. 

[**11**] They have as king over them, the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is [**(g)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/9.htm#fn)Abaddon, and in the Greek he has the name [**(h)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/9.htm#fn)Apollyon.

[**12**] The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are still coming after these things.

The Sixth Trumpet: Army from the East

[**13**] Then the sixth angel sounded, and I heard [**(i)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/9.htm#fn)a voice from the [**(j)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/9.htm#fn)four horns of the golden altar which is before God, 

[**14**] saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.” 

[**15**] And the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released, so that they would kill a third of mankind. 

[**16**]The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million; I heard the number of them. 

[**17**] And this is how I saw in my vision the horses and those who sat on them: the riders had breastplates the color of fire, of hyacinth, and of [**(k)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/9.htm#fn)brimstone; and the heads of the horses are like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths *came fire and smoke and [**(l)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/9.htm#fn)brimstone. 

[**18**] A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues, by the fire, the smoke, and the [**(m)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/9.htm#fn)brimstone which came out of their mouths. 

[**19**] For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents and have heads, and with them they do harm.

[**20**] The rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands so as not to worship demons and the idols of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk; 

[**21**] and they did not repent of their murders, nor of their witchcraft, nor of their sexual immorality, nor of their thefts.
