        c. Review of Last Week’s Comments…
                1. Eschatology is ______________________________________________________________ 
                2. From the Greek word eschatos, meaning “last in time or in place” 
                3. How we view Eschatology has a direct impact on how we look at current events (Vaccine mandates, Afghanistan), how we live our lives (witnessing), & what we invest our time in (this class & church)
                4. Proper Hermeneutics is a must (hermeneutics is “_______________________________”) 
                5. Context, Context, Context (“Text without context is pretext”)
                6. Prophecy is meant to _________________ us, not __________________ us
… the world isn’t falling apart, the pieces are falling together
                7. Eschatology not only limited to Revelation.  Major eschatological books include Daniel, Ezekiel, Isaiah, all four Gospels, 1 & 2 Thessalonians & Revelation
                8. The Bible is over 25% prophecy
   1,845 OT references to Christ’s RETURN (17 OT Books)
      318 NT references to Christ’s RETURN (216 chp. in 23 books)
