## Can we be assured of the inspiration, inerrancy & infallibility of the Bible?  ABSOLUTELY!!!
1. This question deals with 3 very important issues & processes: inspiration, preservation, and translation.
1. The doctrine of the inspiration of the Bible teaches that scripture is “God-breathed” … what does that mean?
1. God personally superintended the writing process, guiding the human ‘transcribers’ so that His complete & accurate message was recorded
	1. One Author; 66 ‘chapters’ of One Story; recorded by 40 ‘transcribers’ over 1,500 years … all with no errors, conflicts or contradictions!   (2 Timothy 3:16  & 2 Peter 1:21)
1. Can the meanings of words change over time?  YES!  As an example, in Colossians 3:12, Paul says we are to put on the “bowels of mercies” (KJV). The Greek word for “bowels,” which is literally “intestines,” comes from a root word meaning “spleen.” 
1. The KJV translators chose a literal translation of the word. The translators of the NASB chose “heart of compassion”—the “heart” being what today’s culture thinks of as the seat of emotions, though we know even that is just a colloquialism. The Amplified Bible has it as “tenderhearted pity and mercy.” The NIV simply puts “compassion.”
1. So, the KJV is the most literal in the above example, but the other translations certainly do justice to the verse. The core meaning of the command is to have compassionate feelings.
1. As a general rule, the more literal translations, such as the KJV & NKJV, the ASB & NASB, have less “interpretative” work.
