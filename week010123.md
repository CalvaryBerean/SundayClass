## The Book of Daniel
1. No other book in the Bible has been as vindicated (corroborated) by history as the Book of Daniel
1. Details recorded in Daniel have been confirmed as historically correct through archaeological discoveries show that the author of Daniel had to have been an eye witness to the events recorded.
1. Daniel recorded is both Hebrew and Aramaic:
	1. Daniel 1:1-2:4 recorded in Hebrew
	1. Daniel 2:4 – 7:28 recorded in Aramaic
	1. Daniel Chapters 8-12, back to Hebrew
1. Shakespeare was wrong: there IS significance in a name!
	1. Daniel’s Hebrew name means “God is my Judge”
 Babylonian name Belteshazzar means “Bel Protects Him”
 (Bel, AKA ‘Marduk’ was the chief god of Babylon)
	1. Hananiah’s Hebrew name means “God Has Been Gracious”
 Babylonian name Shadrach name means “The Commander of Aku”
 (“Aku” are spirits of the dead)
	1. Mishael’s Hebrew name means “Who is like God” or “Who is What God is”
 Babylonian name Mishach means “Belonging to Aku”
	1. Azariah’s Hebrew name means “The Lord is my Helper”
 Babylonian name Abednego means “Servant of Nego”
 (“Nego” was the Babylonian god of vegetation & the patron god of writing)
1. Daniel is both historic and prophetic  
1. Daniel is not in chronological order; if it were, the order would be
1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 10, 11, 12
