# Frequently Asked Questions

## How is this site generated, maintained?
A word doc is provided by Randy Duke and is manually converted into a static [Github Markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf). 
The converted file is commited into version control [here](https://github.com/CalvaryBerean/SundayClass) and using the [Github pages feature](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) converted to a web site. 

## Where can I find a PDF version of the weekly handout?
When you go to the [main page](https://www.sjcalvaryberean.com/) and click on any of the weekly links you will find a link at the top that opens a PDF version of the hand out. For example it will say at the top `Download for PDF version of the handout`. Click on that.

## Can I print the web page?
Yes. Printing from your browser should work. 

## The printed handout at our meeting included an image. Why does the web page not show that?
We are using a very simple web site tool. Yes its possible to upload images, but out of time reasons its a lot of times skipped. You still can get to the image by downloading the PDF version of the class. See above `Where can I find a PDF version of the weekly handout?`
