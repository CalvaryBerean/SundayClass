## I’ve always wondered …

1. Does the Protestant Church perform exorcisms? Why do Catholics seem to perform more?

	1. The teaching portions of the New Testament (Romans through Jude) refer to demonic activity, yet don’t discuss the actions of casting them out, nor are believers exhorted to do so.
	1. We‘re told to put on the armor of God to stand against Satan & his demons (Ephesians 6:10-18). We’re told to resist the devil (James 4:7), be ‘careful’ of him (1 Peter 5:8), and not give him room in our lives (Ephesians 4:27). However, we’re not told HOW to cast him or his demons out of others, or that we should even consider doing so
	v. Remember, it isn’t Catholics or Protestants who cast out demons … IT IS JESUS THROUGH THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT that casts out demons. (see Acts 19:13–16) … & remember 1 John 4:4
	1. I would argue that the Protestant faiths perform MORE exorcisms and cast out MORE demons than do the Catholics … they just have better agents in Hollywood (just kidding!)
1. Predestination & the Elect (“Did God really create some people just to send them to hell?”)
	1. The question really rests on the difference and blending of Free Will vs. Predestination vs. God’s Foreknowledge vs. God’s Sovereignty
	1. Even Calvin did not teach ‘ultra-Calvinism’ (the belief that “some were created to burn”) 
	2. Remember John 3:15-17 … and John 1:12; 3:16; Acts 16:31; Romans 10:9–10; Revelation 22:17

1. Regarding the Millennial Reign of Christ, why do we need to come back to a post-tribulation destroyed Earth to live? Why would Jesus want a reign in such a place when I thought there was supposed to be a new heaven and a new Earth? Why once we are raptured to heaven to be with Jesus forever, would we return to Earth only to die again in mortal bodies? 
	1. The major scripture dealing with the Millennial Reign is Rev 20:4 , however there is also reference in Dan 7:27, Rev 5:9-10, Rev 2:25-26, Mat 25:20-21, Luke 22:28-30, and 2 Tim 2:12

1. It says in the Bible that some believers will not experience death as they are living in the time when Jesus will rapture his sheep. Is this true? Will some be taken up without experiencing death?
	1. The simple answer is yes. The two almost parallel bible references referring to this are 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 and 1 Corinthians 15:51-58.
	1. Blue Letter Bible commentary: [https://bit.ly/3L6oyUo](https://bit.ly/3L6oyUo) From these passages we can make the following 3 observations. 
		1. Not Everyone Will Die
		Although death has been the norm for humanity, the Old Testament recorded two prominent exceptions - Enoch and Elijah. The New Testament also says that a living generation of Christians will not experience death, but will be taken up to meet the Lord.
		1. Not Everyone will need to be Resurrected 
		Those believers who are living at the time of the rapture of the church, will not have to be resurrected. They will be changed, while they are alive, from mortal to immortal, from corruptible to incorruptible.
		3. The raptured meet Christ in glorified bodies
		Those who are instantaneously changed at the time of the rapture of the church will be with Christ for all eternity in their glorified body.
		3. Summary 
		Resurrection from the dead will be what most believers experience. A small number in comparison will not die but will be changed as was the case with the Old Testament characters Enoch and Elijah. This event is known as the "rapture" or "translation" of the church.
