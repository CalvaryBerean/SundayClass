1. 6 Hebrew words every Believer should know  (article:  [https://bit.ly/3MugUlR](https://bit.ly/3MugUlR) )
	1. **Shalom** שָׁלוֹם     (shuh-LOM) a rich word which means “peace” or “well-being.” 

	To have shalom means to be in peace and prosperity and to have completeness. Shalom is what we want to see restored after the fall of humanity.  The noun occurs 237 times in the OT
	1. **Torah**    תּוֹרָה   (tȯr-ə)
	
	The first five books of the Old Testament.  The word itself means “law” or “direction, guidance, instruction.”  It occurs 220 times in the Hebrew OT, 36 times in the Psalms.  Torah can refer specifically to the first five books of the Old Testament or it can refer to an overall body of instruction.  “Instruction” is probably a better translation than even “law”
	1. **Hesed** חֶ֫סֶד       (kheh-sed)
	
	This is one of those words that really has no English or even Greek equivalent. Often translated as love, that falls far short of its meaning.  Mercy, compassion, love, grace,and faithfulness relate to the Hebrew word hesed, but none of these completely summarize the concept.  Hesed is not merely an emotion or feeling but involves action on behalf of someone who is in need.  The word hesed appears 245 times in the OT and is pretty evenly distributed throughout the OT. 
	1. **Shabbat**  שׁבת     (shə-ˈbät)
	
	There’s a verbal form of this word that appears 71 times in the Old Testament.  The more formal “Sabbath” appears 111 times.  The word itself means “to cease” or “to come to an end.”  It means to completely rest. Old Testament. 
	1. **Pesach**   פֶּסַח   (pāˌsäKH)
	
	This word is translated Passover.  In Exodus 12-13 we read of the death angel passing over the house of the Israelites and not slaying their firstborn. It was then to be a yearly memorial.  Passover then takes upon massive significance throughout the Bible.  It is connected to the Lord’s deliverance. The Lord Jesus would have celebrated this meal with his disciples.
	1. **Mashiach**  מָשִׁיחַ    (maw-shee'-akh)
	
	It means Messiah — anointed one.  This word only appears 39 times in the Old Testament, but one could say that the entire Bible is centered around this word.  Later the term Messiah took on a bigger role. The people longed for Messiah to come and save them and to rescue them.  We ultimately see that Jesus is the prophet, priest, and king — the Anointed One who was foretold.
