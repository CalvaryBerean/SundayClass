## Dr. Chuck Missler expands on Daniel Chapter 4:
1. “Nebuchadnezzar’s Affidavit” (a written statement confirmed by oath or affirmation) 
1. Longest chapter in Daniel; authored by Nebuchadnezzar 
1. Nebuchadnezzar’s 2nd dream & the consequences of pride
1. Not to diminish God’s right to do WHATEVER He wants, but Nebuchadnezzar’s condition is an actual malady called boanthropy where a person believes himself to be a bovine (a cow or an ox). Please note: I am NOT saying all mental health issues are judgements from God.
