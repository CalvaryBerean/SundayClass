	1. Russia is attacking Ukraine because of a weak America and because she may be gearing up to strike “the mountains of Israel” in the Gog-Magog War of Ezekiel 38-39. Such massive global instability tells us the world is longing for a leader. His title is Antichrist.

## Revelation, Chapter 8
[New American Standard Bible](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/8.htm)

The Seventh Seal: Trumpets

[**1**] When the Lamb broke the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. 

[**2**] And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.

[**3**] Another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, so that he might [**(a)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/8.htm#fn)add it to the prayers of all the [**(b)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/8.htm#fn)saints on the golden altar which was before the throne. 

[**4**] And the smoke of the incense ascended from the angel’s hand with the prayers of the [**(c)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/8.htm#fn)saints before God. 

[**5**] Then the angel [**(d)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/8.htm#fn)took the [**(e)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/8.htm#fn)censer and filled it with the fire of the altar, and hurled it to the earth; and there were peals of thunder and sounds, and flashes of lightning and an earthquake.

[**6**] And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them.

[**7**] The first sounded, and there was hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.

[**8**] The second angel sounded, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea; and a third of the sea became blood, 9and a third of the creatures which were in the sea [**(f)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/8.htm#fn)and had life, died; and a third of the ships were destroyed.

[**10**] The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of waters. 

[**11**] The star is named Wormwood; and a third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from the waters because they were made bitter.

[**12**] The fourth angel sounded, and a third of the sun, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars were struck, so that a third of them would be darkened and the day would not shine for a third of it, and the night in the same way.

[**13**] Then I looked, and I heard [**(g)**](https://biblehub.com/nasb_/revelation/8.htm#fn)an eagle flying in midheaven, saying with a loud voice, “Woe, woe, woe to those who live on the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!”
