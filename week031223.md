1. News Highlights from this week’s Amir Tsarfati’s ‘Telegram’ feeds 
	1. Mar 5:  The head of the Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, last night: “an Israeli attack on Iran "is an illegal thing".   Netanyahu: "Grossi just said in Tehran that an Israeli attack on the Iranian nuclear facilities is illegal. Outside what law? Is it allowed for Iran, which openly calls for our destruction, to defend the instruments of destruction that will slaughter us? Are we not allowed to defend ourselves?”
	1. Mar 5:  Fox News: Russia and Iran have reached an agreement where Moscow may soon return to Tehran the stockpile of enriched uranium it transferred to it after the signing of the nuclear agreement in 2015.
	1. Mar 8:  Israel’s head of the National Security Council - “Israel is ready to strike Iran and the Americans know about it! Israel will not rely on anyone in order to take care of its security!” 
	1. Mar 9:  The US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin landed in Israel to hold meetings with Israel’s prime minister and defense minister. Unprecedented joint military exercises of the Israeli & American air forces. 
	1. Mar 9:  The Wall Street Journal: Saudi Arabia demands - an American guarantee for its security and permission to develop a civilian nuclear program in exchange for a peace agreement with Israel.
	1. Mar 10:  The Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, & his Saudi & Chinese counterparts signed an agreement to renew diplomatic relations between Riyadh and Tehran in Beijing. 
	1. Mar 10:  The Chinese Foreign Ministry after the signing of the agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran just stated “The US must end its illegal military presence on Syrian territory immediately.”
	1. Mar 11:  Can a leopard change its spots? Can Iran suddenly love Saudi Arabia? Will the Chinese deal hold water? The answer to all the above is: NO! The Saudis needs security. Iran needs stability. China needs nobility.  It’s all a game of interests!  I trust my Bible: Saudi Arabia will protest the Russian-Iranian invasion into Israel as described in Ezekiel 38.  God will surely punish and destroy the invaders!  Best of all: Jesus is coming soon!

## Special Guest Speaker: Prof. Thoas Winder, Founder of Holy Land Research Institute in Majdal Shams.  The mission of HLRI is to restore the Orthodox Church of the Transfiguration and complete the work on the true location of the Transfiguration. ([https://www.HolyLandResearchInstitute.org](https://www.HolyLandResearchInstitute.org)) 
1. “The REAL site of the Transfiguration”.  The Transfiguration is recorded in all three of the Synoptic Gospels (Mark 9:2–13; Matthew 17:1–13; Luke 9:28–36) and is the revelation of the eternal glory & divinity of Christ, which was normally veiled during His earthly ministry.
