1. Some general thoughts: 2 kits minimum (1 for home; 1 for each car); Rotate supplies each yr; If you have the space at your home, water barrels store multiple days’ supply for multiple people; Refill your car’s gas tank when it reaches HALF FULL; If you store some extra gas, use PRI-G or Sta-bil to stabilize the gas (PRI-G will ‘rejuvenate’ gas; Sta-bil will only stabilize fresh gas); If you have life-saving medical machinery (CPAP machine, oxygen machine, etc.) that requires power you might want to consider Battery powered version, Power Inverter or Generator
1. Cellular networks are designed to only support 10% of the total subscribers in a given ‘cell’; they are COMPLETELY overloaded in a crisis situation; Instead of calling, send info via Texts & Social Media, or use apps like WhatsApp & Signal to communicate; Download Zello to use your cell phone like a walkie-talkie & first aid apps like Red Cross First Aid & iTriage
