## Review of Last Week’s Comments
1. Eschatology is the Biblical study of end time events 
1. From the Greek word eschatos, meaning “last in time or in place” 
1. How we view Eschatology has a direct impact on how we look at current world events, how we live our lives, & what we invest our time in
1. Controversial: Some churches avoid Eschatology as an area of study
1. Proper Hermeneutics is a must 
1. Context, Context, Context (“Text without context is pretext”)
1. Eschatology not only limited to Revelation.  Major eschatological books include Daniel, Ezekiel, Isaiah, all four Gospels, 1 & 2 Thessalonians & Revelation
1. The Bible is over 25% prophecy
	1. 1,845 OT references to Christ’s RETURN (17 OT Books)
	1. 318 NT references to Christ’s RETURN (216 chp. in 23 books)
1. Prophecy is meant to PREPARE us, not SCARE us… the world isn’t falling apart, the pieces are falling together
