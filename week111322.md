## Some additional info on how large the New Jerusalem measures; translation & measurements
1. “… 12,000 stadia in length, and as wide and high as it is long.” (NIV, ESV, Berean, NASB, Christian Standard, Holman)
1. “… 12,000 furlongs: the length, breadth and height thereof are equal”  (ASV, KJV, NKJV)
1. “… its length and width and height were each 1,400 miles.”  (NLV, Amplified)
1. “1,500 miles” (NASB 1995, NASB 1977)
1. twelve thousand furlongs  The measure would be about 1378 English miles, according to the lower computation (Cambridge Bible Commentary)
1. Stadia or Stadion: a measure of length comprising 600 Greek feet, or 625 Roman feet (607 US feet), or 125 Roman paces, hence, one-eighth of a Roman mile.  So 12,000 x 607 feet = 1,400 miles
1. 1,500 Miles: From the west coast to the east coast of the United States, it is approximately 3,000 miles across.
1. Either way the New Jerusalem is REALLY, REALLY BIG!

### Dr. Missler discusses the dimensionality of the New Jerusalem … & wonders is it not bound by our 3 dimensions?
1. For the record, I take a slightly more ‘literal’ reading of Revelation than Dr. Missler, but take great solace and peace that regardless, my home is with Jesus!
